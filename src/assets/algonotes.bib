    abstract = { Given an undirected graph \$G=(V, E)\$ and a delta-matroid \$(V,{\cal F})\$, the delta-matroid matching problem is to find a maximum cardinality matching \$M\$ such that the set of the end vertices of \$M\$ belongs to \${\cal F}\$. This problem is a natural generalization of the matroid matching problem to delta-matroids, and thus it cannot be solved in polynomial time in general. This paper introduces a class of the delta-matroid matching problem, where the given delta-matroid is a projection of a linear delta-matroid. We first show that it can be solved in polynomial time if the given linear delta-matroid is generic. This result enlarges a polynomially solvable class of matching problems with precedence constraints on vertices such as the 2-master/slave matching. In addition, we design a polynomial-time algorithm when the graph is bipartite and the delta-matroid is defined on one vertex side. This result is extended to the case where a linear matroid constraint is additionally imposed on the other vertex side. }
